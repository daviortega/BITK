This is my personal bioinformatics toolkit.
It is mainly written in python, tcl (vmd) and maybe in bash.
If you want to use you should include in your .bashrc something like this:

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/ortega/bitk/bitk_lib/
export PATH="${PATH}:$(find /home/ortega/bitk -name '.*' -prune -o -type d -printf ':%p')"

where /home/ortega/ is the path to where bitk files were copied.

Also you may also want to install the following python packages:

numpy
scipy
multiprocessing
MDAnalysis
rpy2

Enjoy!
Ps.: Before I started to use git repo I made a backup copy of everything on god

About the Repository
##################################################
There are two main branches: master and experimental.

The master branch has bitk_lib and stable subdirectories
The experimental has both and labs.

The way I am working on this is the following:

1) pull the repository
2) switch to experimental and in the directory labs do the work.
3) Multiple commits later, when the work is ready, copy the graduated script to stable and commit one more time.
4) switch to master
5) merge to experimental
6) remove labs
7) comit master
8) tag it if necessary
9) push upstream.

There is probably a more elegant way to do this, but this is only my 2nd day.
