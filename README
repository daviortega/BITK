This is my personal bioinformatics toolkit.
It is mainly written in python, tcl (vmd) and maybe in bash.
If you want to use you should include in your .bashrc something like this:

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/ortega/bitk/bitk_lib/
export PATH="${PATH}:$(find /home/ortega/bitk -name '.*' -prune -o -type d -printf ':%p')"

where /home/ortega/ is the path to where bitk files were copied.

Also you may also want to install the following python packages:

numpy
scipy
multiprocessing
MDAnalysis
rpy2

Enjoy!
Ps.: Before I started to use git repo I made a backup copy of everything on god
